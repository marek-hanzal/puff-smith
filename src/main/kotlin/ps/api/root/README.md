# Root Module

Access to these endpoints should be strictly prohibited just to users having right role (thus being super-natural humans).

As taking out parts of this module for "convenience" could lead to huge data leaks and security problems.

Note that endpoints basically corresponds with front-end site, so user's stuff cannot read/update data from here and root stuff should not read data from user.
